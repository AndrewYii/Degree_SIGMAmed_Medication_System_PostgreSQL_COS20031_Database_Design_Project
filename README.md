# COS20031 – Database Design Project
This repository is used to track progress, updates, and deliverables for the **SIGMAmed** group project in the COS20031 unit. The goal of this project is to design and implement a relational database for a medication management system.

It serves as both a record of our work and a communication tool so that the lecturer, tutor, as well as members can easily follow our updates.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL**
- **Platform**: **Supabase**, used to host the database for online simulation and testing.
- **IDE**: **Visual Studio Code**
- **Version Control**: **Git** & **GitHub**

---
## 💻 Prerequisites
To contribute to this project, you will need the following installed and configured:

- **Git**: Required for cloning the repository and managing version control.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The recommended code editor for this project.
- **PostgreSQL Extension for VS Code**: Essential for connecting to our Supabase database and running `.sql` scripts directly from the editor.

---
## 📌 Purpose
- To systematically document the design and implementation of the database schema.
- To provide clear version tracking for major project deliverables, such as the ERD and final SQL scripts.
- To maintain transparency on incremental updates, including schema modifications, function creation, and documentation changes.

## 🔖 Versioning Guidelines
The repository uses a **(x.y)** versioning system:

- **x (Major Update version):**
  - Incremented when a major idea is finished and approved by the lecturer.
  - Example: Completing the database schema design and ERD → **1.0**

- **y (Minor Update version):**
  - Incremented for smaller updates (e.g., adding a new table, creating a function, updating documentation, bug fixing, inserting dummy value).
  - Example: After adding the `Prescriptions` table to `schema.sql` → **1.1**

- **Format Example:**
  - **1.0** → Database Schema Design & ERD Finished and Approved.
